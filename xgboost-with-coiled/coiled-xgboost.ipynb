    "# Scaling XGBoost with Dask and Coiled\n",
    "This notebook shows you how to solve the common **MemoryError** issue that is thrown whenever you try to train an XGBoost model that doesn't fit into your memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "You'll learn how to leverage **distributed [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) training** for effective modelling on datasets that exceed the hardware limitations of your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you will learn to write code to:\n",
    "1. Train a distributed XGBoost model locally on a small dataset using [Dask](https://dask.org/), \n",
    "2. Scale your distributed XGBoost model to the cloud using Dask and [Coiled](https://coiled.io/) to train on a larger-than-memory dataset,\n",
    "3. Speed up your training with Pro tips from the Dask core team.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the Dataset\n",
    "We'll be using a ~20GB subset of the Arcos dataset released by the Washington Post.\n",

    "## 1. Local Distributed XGBoost Model using Dask\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, XGBoost trains models sequentially. This is fine for smaller projects, but when the size of your dataset and/or ML model exceeds the limitations of your local machine, you will want to leverage the potential of distributed computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from version 1.0, XGBoost comes with a native Dask integration that makes this possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "It only requires two changes to your regular XGBoostcode:\n",
    "1. substitute `dtrain = xgb.DMatrix(X_train, y_train)` with `dtrain = xgb.dask.DaskDMatrix(X_train, y_train)`, and\n",
    "2. substitute `xgb.train(params, dtrain, ...)` with `xgb.dask.train(client, params, dtrain, ...)`\n",

    "### Instantiate Dask Cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by instantiating a local version of the Dask distributed scheduler, which will orchestrate the distributed processing of our model. Read more about the Dask schedulers [here](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/)."

    "## 3. Pro Tips to Speed Up Training\n",
    "Below we’ve collected some pro tips straight from the Dask core team to help you speed up your XGBoost training:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Re-cast numerical columns to less memory-intensive dtypes. For example, convert float64 into int16 whenever possible. This will reduce the memory load of your dataframe and thereby speed up training.\n",
    "- The Dask Dashboard is a great way to spot bottle-necks and identify opportunities for increased performance in your code. Watch the initial author of Dask, Matt Rocklin, explain how to get the most out of the Dask Dashboard [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_GqzcuGLCY).\n",
    "- Read Matthew Power’s blog on setting up the Dask Dashboard in your Jupyter Lab environment [here](https://coiled.io/blog/dask-jupyterlab-workflow/). \n",
    "- Read Dask core contributor Guido Imperiale’s blog on how to tackle the specific issue of unmanaged memory in Dask workers [here](https://coiled.io/blog/tackling-unmanaged-memory-with-dask/). \n",

    "Let’s recap what we’ve discussed in this notebook:\n",
    "- When training XGBoost with large datasets, running out of local memory can be a challenge. \n",
    "- Connecting XGboost to a local Dask cluster allows you to make the most out of the multiple cores in your machine.\n",
    "- If that’s still not enough, you can connect Dask to Coiled and burst to the cloud as and when needed.\n",
    "- You can tweak your distributed XGBoost performance by inspecting the Dask Dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’d love to see you apply distributed XGBoost to a dataset that’s meaningful to you. If you’d like to try, swap your dataset into this notebook and see how well it does! \n",
